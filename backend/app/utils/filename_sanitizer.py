Unicode-safe filename sanitization utilities.

This module provides robust filename sanitization that preserves Unicode characters
while removing only unsafe symbols that are invalid in filenames across major
operating systems.

def sanitize_filename(text: str) -> str:
    """
    Sanitize a filename to be safe across all operating systems while preserving Unicode characters.

    This function:
    - Preserves all alphabetic characters from any language (Vietnamese, French, Japanese, etc.)
    - Removes only unsafe symbols and reserved characters
    - Normalizes Unicode characters to prevent encoding issues
    - Replaces spaces with hyphens for consistency

        text: The text to sanitize for use as a filename

    Returns:
        A sanitized filename safe for use across operating systems

    Examples:
        >>> sanitize_filename("Nguyen Pham Gia Huy")
        "Nguyen-Pham-Gia-Huy"

        >>> sanitize_filename("Chợ Tốt")
