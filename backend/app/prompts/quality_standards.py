# Factual integrity requirements
FACTUAL_INTEGRITY_REQUIREMENTS = """
### FACTUAL INTEGRITY - MANDATORY RULES

**Experience Duration:**
- NEVER fabricate or exaggerate duration of employment
- Calculate duration ONLY from explicit start/end dates in source CV
- If dates are missing or ambiguous, use neutral phrasing
- Examples:
  - ✅ "3-month internship" when dates given: Aug 2024 - Nov 2024
  - ✅ "Short-term position" when dates unknown
  - ❌ "6-month role" when actual duration was 3 months
  - ❌ "Led team for 2 years" when actual was 6 months

**Quantification Rules:**
- Only include metrics that can be derived from source material
- Never invent numbers, percentages, or scale indicators
- If data exists but is vague, use conservative estimates
- Example: "Multiple teams" not "10+ teams" unless explicitly stated

**Accuracy Preservation:**
- Maintain exact company names, job titles, and institutions
- Preserve all certifications and credentials exactly as stated
- Keep education degree types and names unchanged
- No modernization of titles or organizations

# Enhanced factual integrity (for slicing prompt)
ENHANCED_FACTUAL_INTEGRITY = """
### ENHANCED FACTUAL INTEGRITY - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS

**CRITICAL RULE:** Every single detail in the enhanced CV must be verifiable from the source CV. When in doubt, omit rather than invent.

**Employment Data Preservation:**
- Preserve job titles exactly as stated in source CV
- Keep company names unchanged
- Maintain employment dates precisely (no rounding or estimation)
- Preserve all factual details about roles and responsibilities

**Education and Credentials:**
- Keep degree names and institutions exactly as stated
- Preserve GPA, honors, and academic distinctions verbatim
- Maintain certification names and issuing organizations
- Keep education dates accurate to the source

**Personal Information:**
- Preserve all personal information (GPA, awards, certifications) as stated
- No embellishments or improvements to credentials
- Keep accurate representation of qualifications

**Ambiguity Handling:**
- When clarifying ambiguous phrasing, stay conservative
- Choose the most conservative interpretation
- If information is missing, omit rather than invent or estimate
- Prioritize truthfulness over completeness

**Verification Protocol:**
- Every achievement must be traceable to source CV
- Every skill must appear in the original document
- Every date must match the source exactly
- Every number must be derivable from provided data

**Examples of Proper Handling:**
- ✅ "Fast-paced environment" when source says "startup culture"
- ✅ "Team collaboration" when source mentions "worked with team"
- ❌ "Managed 5-person team" when source doesn't mention team size
- ❌ "Increased revenue by 30%" when source only says "improved sales"
