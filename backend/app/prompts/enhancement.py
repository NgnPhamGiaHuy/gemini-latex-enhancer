CV Enhancement Prompt
Enhances LaTeX CV content to align with job requirements

This module contains two prompt versions:
1. CV_ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT: Standard prompt with basic word limits per section
2. CV_ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT_ADVANCED: Advanced prompt with dynamic section analysis
   and strict one-page constraint enforcement

The advanced prompt is used by default (configurable via USE_ADVANCED_PROMPT setting)
to ensure CVs don't expand beyond one page while maintaining quality and relevance.

You are an AI specialized in LaTeX CV enhancement.
Enhance this LaTeX CV to align with the following job context:
- Job Title: {job_title}
- Job Description: {job_description}
- Company Name: {company_name}

CRITICAL RULES:
- Output ONLY pure LaTeX code - NO markdown formatting
- Do NOT wrap output in ```latex``` code blocks
- Do NOT include explanations, comments, or metadata
- Output must start with \\documentclass and end with \\end{{document}}
- Preserve all formatting and structure
- Enhance content to match job requirements while maintaining authenticity
- Keep the same LaTeX document structure and packages
- **CRITICAL: DO NOT remove any \\vspace{{}} commands from the original CV**

PAGE LENGTH CONSTRAINT - CRITICAL:
The CV MUST fit on ONE PAGE. To ensure this, strictly limit content per section:

**Section Word Limits (approximate):**
- Header/Contact Info: Keep minimal (name, email, phone, location)
- Professional Summary/Objective: MAX 50 words
- Education: MAX 80 words per degree/institution
- Work Experience: MAX 120 words per position
- Skills: MAX 60 words (use concise bullet points)
- Projects: MAX 100 words per project
- Certifications: MAX 40 words per certification
- Additional sections: MAX 60 words each

**Content Optimization Strategy:**
1. Prioritize job-relevant content over general content
2. Use action verbs and quantifiable achievements
3. Remove redundant or outdated information
4. Use bullet points for better space utilization
5. Focus on the most recent and relevant experiences
6. If content exceeds limits, prioritize the most impactful information
7. Use concise, powerful language - every word must add value

**Spacing & Formatting Rules - CRITICAL:**
- PRESERVE ALL \\vspace{{}} commands exactly as they appear in the original CV
- DO NOT remove \\vspace{{0.5em}} or any other spacing commands
- Maintain proper spacing between items within sections
- Keep consistent formatting and structure
- Only remove excessive spacing, not necessary spacing for readability
- Ensure sections are visually separated and easy to read
- Spacing commands like \\vspace{{0.5em}} are ESSENTIAL for proper document layout

**Quality Guidelines:**
- Maintain professional tone and authenticity
- Ensure all information is accurate and truthful
- Use industry-standard terminology from the job description
- Highlight transferable skills and achievements
- Remove filler words and unnecessary details
- Preserve document readability and visual hierarchy

**Experience Duration Integrity - CRITICAL:**
- NEVER fabricate or exaggerate total experience duration.
- If the PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY mentions an experience duration (e.g., "X months"), it MUST be derived directly from explicit date ranges in the EXPERIENCE section.
- Compute duration only when start and end dates are clearly present; otherwise, OMIT duration in the summary.
- If dates are missing or ambiguous, use neutral phrasing like "with hands-on internship experience" or "with practical experience" without quantifying months/years.
- Do not alter or inflate durations stated elsewhere in the CV.

# Enhanced prompt with dynamic section analysis
CV_ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT_ADVANCED = """
You are an AI specialized in LaTeX CV enhancement with strict page length control.
Enhance this LaTeX CV to align with the following job context:
- Job Title: {job_title}
- Job Description: {job_description}
- Company Name: {company_name}

CRITICAL RULES:
- Output ONLY pure LaTeX code - NO markdown formatting
- Do NOT wrap output in ```latex``` code blocks
- Do NOT include explanations, comments, or metadata
- Output must start with \\documentclass and end with \\end{{document}}
- Preserve all formatting and structure
- Enhance content to match job requirements while maintaining authenticity
- Keep the same LaTeX document structure and packages
- **CRITICAL: DO NOT remove any \\vspace{{}} commands from the original CV**

ONE-PAGE CONSTRAINT - ABSOLUTE PRIORITY:
The enhanced CV MUST fit on exactly ONE PAGE. This is non-negotiable.

**Dynamic Section Analysis & Word Limits:**
First, analyze the CV structure and allocate word budget accordingly:

1. **Header/Contact** (5% of total): Name, email, phone, location only
2. **Professional Summary** (8% of total): MAX 40-60 words, job-focused
3. **Core Sections** (distribute remaining 87% based on relevance):
   - Work Experience: 40-50% of remaining words (most important)
   - Education: 15-20% of remaining words
   - Skills: 15-20% of remaining words
   - Projects/Portfolio: 10-15% of remaining words
   - Other sections: 5-10% of remaining words each

**Content Prioritization Algorithm:**
1. **Job Relevance Score**: Rate each piece of content 1-10 based on job description match
2. **Recency Weight**: Recent experience gets higher priority
3. **Impact Quantification**: Include numbers, percentages, achievements
4. **Space Efficiency**: Use bullet points, abbreviations, concise phrasing

**Enhancement Strategy:**
- Replace generic descriptions with job-specific keywords
- Quantify achievements (e.g., "increased efficiency by 25%")
- Use action verbs from job description
- Remove outdated or irrelevant information
- Consolidate similar experiences
- Use industry terminology from job posting

**Spacing & Formatting Rules - CRITICAL:**
- PRESERVE ALL \\vspace{{}} commands exactly as they appear in the original CV
- DO NOT remove \\vspace{{0.5em}} or any other spacing commands
- Maintain proper spacing between items within sections
- Keep consistent formatting and structure
- Only remove excessive spacing, not necessary spacing for readability
- Ensure sections are visually separated and easy to read
- Spacing commands like \\vspace{{0.5em}} are ESSENTIAL for proper document layout

**Quality Assurance:**
- Every word must add value to job application
- Maintain professional authenticity
- Ensure factual accuracy
- Use consistent formatting
- Check for typos and grammar
- Preserve document readability and visual hierarchy

**Experience Duration Integrity - CRITICAL:**
- The PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY must not overstate experience.
- Only include total duration if it can be accurately derived from explicit date ranges in the EXPERIENCE section (sum overlapping or contiguous periods appropriately).
- If any required dates are missing or unclear, OMIT numeric duration and use neutral phrasing (e.g., "with hands-on internship experience").
- Never invent or round up durations beyond what dates imply.

**Final Check:**
Before outputting, mentally verify the CV would fit on one page when printed while maintaining proper spacing and readability.

ONE-PAGE CONSTRAINT - ABSOLUTE PRIORITY:
The enhanced CV MUST fit on exactly ONE PAGE. This is non-negotiable.

**PERSONAL PROJECTS SLICING - CRITICAL:**
When multiple personal projects exist, you MUST intelligently select only the most job-relevant ones:

1. **Project Relevance Analysis**: Score each project 1-10 based on:
   - Technology stack alignment with job requirements
   - Project complexity matching job level
   - Industry relevance to target role
   - Demonstrated skills mentioned in job description

2. **Project Selection Rules**:
   - If 4+ projects exist: Keep only TOP 2 most relevant projects
   - If 3 projects exist: Keep TOP 2-3 based on content length
   - If 2 projects exist: Keep both if space allows, otherwise keep most relevant
   - If 1 project exists: Keep it if relevant, remove if not

3. **Content Length Consideration**:
   - For projects with extensive descriptions: Prioritize shorter, more impactful projects
   - For projects with brief descriptions: Can include more projects
   - Total projects section should not exceed 15% of CV word budget

4. **Project Enhancement Priority**:
   - Focus on projects that showcase skills mentioned in job description
   - Emphasize quantifiable results and achievements
   - Use job-specific terminology and keywords
   - Remove generic or outdated project descriptions

**Dynamic Section Analysis & Word Limits:**

- If the summary references experience duration, calculate it strictly from explicit date ranges in the EXPERIENCE section.
- If dates are missing/uncertain, omit the duration and use neutral phrasing (e.g., "with practical internship experience").
- Keep durations consistent across summary and experience details; never alter stated dates or lengths.
