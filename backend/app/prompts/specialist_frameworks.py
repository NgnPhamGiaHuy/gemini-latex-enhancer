   If no, remove or use qualitative language instead.

4. Structural Check: "Will this LaTeX code compile without errors?"
   If unsure, simplify the LaTeX syntax.

5. Consistency Check: "Is the enhanced CV internally consistent?"
   If no inconsistencies detected, proceed; if found, resolve them.

**Consequences of Violation:**
Violating anti-hallucination guardrails results in:
- CV that cannot be verified in job interviews
- Loss of user trust in the system
- Potential ethical and legal issues
- Complete failure of the enhancement mission
- Compromised user's professional credibility

**Absolute Zero-Tolerance Policy:**
There is NO acceptable level of fabrication, invention, or hallucination. The 
enhancement must maintain 100% factual integrity or the entire task is failed.

# Document Structure Analysis Framework
DOCUMENT_STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS = """
## üìã DOCUMENT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

**Purpose:**
Before generating enhanced LaTeX CV content, systematically analyze the existing 
document structure to ensure intelligent, context-aware enhancements that respect 
the original document's formatting conventions.

**Analysis Process:**

Step 1: Structure Detection
Identify the types and hierarchy of sections present:
- Major Sections: Skills, Experience, Education, Projects, Certifications, etc.
- Section Hierarchy: Primary (\\section{}) vs. Secondary (\\subsection{})
- Content Types: Lists, paragraphs, tables, custom environments
- Structural Patterns: Bullet style, spacing conventions, indentation

Detection Tasks:
- Map all sections by type and hierarchy
- Identify custom commands or environments
- Note any unusual or specialized formatting
- Document existing LaTeX packages and dependencies

Step 2: Bolding Pattern Analysis
Examine current bolding patterns in each section:
- Count instances of \\textbf{} usage per section
- Identify over-bolding or excessive emphasis
- Note inconsistent bolding patterns
- Detect errors like nested or double-wrapped bold formatting

Pattern Analysis:
- Skills Section: Are labels bolded? Are items bolded? (Only labels should be)
- Experience/Projects: How many bold terms per bullet? (Should be 2-3 max)
- Languages: Are names bolded? Are proficiencies bolded? (Only names should be)
- Other Sections: What is the bolding strategy? Is it consistent?

Step 3: Consistency Assessment
Check for formatting consistency:
- Section-to-section: Are bolding patterns consistent across similar sections?
- Within-section: Are bolding rules applied uniformly?
- Document-wide: Are formatting conventions maintained throughout?

Consistency Checks:
- Over-bolding detected? If yes, reduce to minimal emphasis
- Under-bolding detected? If appropriate for emphasis, sparingly add
- Inconsistent patterns? If yes, standardize to appropriate rules
- Error patterns? If yes (e.g., \\textbf{{{}}}), fix to single \\textbf{{}}

Step 4: Section-Specific Rule Application
Apply appropriate bolding rules based on section type:
- Skills Sections: Labels only bolded, items plain text
- Languages Sections: Language names only bolded, proficiencies plain
- Experience/Projects: Selective bolding (2-3 key terms per bullet max)
- Other Sections: Evaluate context for appropriate bolding level

Rule Enforcement:
- Scrub Mechanical Bolding: Remove over-bolding from Skills sections
- Review Contextual Bolding: Ensure Experience/Projects use selective emphasis
- Fix Double-Wrapped Format: Correct \\textbf{{{}}} ‚Üí \\textbf{{}}
- Ensure Consistency: Apply same rules across similar sections
- Maintain Standards: Follow section-specific bolding guidelines

Step 5: Pattern Learning and Adaptation
Learn from existing patterns and adapt enhancement approach:
- If source overuses bolding: Adjust to minimal emphasis approach
- If source underuses bolding: Maintain conservative level, add sparingly
- If source has mechanical patterns: Apply intelligent, selective approach
- If source has inconsistent patterns: Standardize to appropriate rules

Adaptation Strategy:
- Respect existing structure while improving intelligently
- Do not introduce excessive new bolding where none existed
- Do not remove appropriate emphasis where it adds value
- Follow principle: "Bold for emphasis, not for decoration"

**Output Requirements for Structure Preservation:**

Structural Preservation:
- ‚úÖ Maintain all LaTeX structure and formatting
- ‚úÖ Preserve section hierarchy and organization
- ‚úÖ Keep document class and package dependencies
- ‚úÖ Maintain environment structure and nesting

Intelligent Enhancement:
- ‚úÖ Apply selective, context-aware bolding
- ‚úÖ Remove over-bolding while preserving meaningful emphasis
- ‚úÖ Standardize inconsistent patterns appropriately
- ‚úÖ Fix structural errors without altering content

Consistency Maintenance:
- ‚úÖ Apply section-specific rules uniformly
- ‚úÖ Maintain consistency within each section
- ‚úÖ Follow established patterns across document
- ‚úÖ Ensure visual hierarchy supports readability

Quality Assurance:
- ‚úÖ Verify structure analysis before enhancement
- ‚úÖ Check bolding patterns for appropriateness
- ‚úÖ Validate consistency across all sections
- ‚úÖ Confirm intelligent application of formatting rules

**Pre-Enhancement Self-Check:**
Before enhancing content, ask:
1. "What is the structure of this document?"
2. "What are the current bolding patterns in each section?"
3. "Are there inconsistencies or excessive bolding?"
4. "What section-specific rules should apply?"
5. "How can I improve intelligently while respecting existing patterns?"

Only after completing structure analysis should content enhancement begin.
